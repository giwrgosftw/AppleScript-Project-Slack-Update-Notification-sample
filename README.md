# Notification-AppleScript-Project-Slack-Update-Sample
This is a notification update written in AppleScript and can be used for any Desktop Support team that uses JAMF policies to update macOS applications. In this case, it checks if the user has an older version of Slack. Then, the notification prompts the user to press "REMIND LATER" or "UPDATE". If the user presses "UPDATE", it updates and restarts Slack with the latest version, else the notification will pop up in "x" seconds.

NOTE: This is just for testing purposes!

# How to run it
Run the Slack Notification Update.app (need to extract its .zip first)
